Trial 15
Hopper 3
316 SS
Batch 0939

30 carrier gas
20 stirrer speed

Considering if increased variation observed at 6-12% turntable in Trial 14
could be resonance associated with absolute  mass on the scales

Turntable run at 4%, 10%, 16%, 10%, 4% for 5 minutes at each condition

Showed increased and comparable variation at both occurrences of 10%
1st occurrence had ~20g mass of powder in addition to mass of tub
2nd occurrence had ~100g mass of powder in addition to mass of tub

Turntable then run at 10% for two videos
1st video shows LDC display on scales where 'pulsing' clearly identifiable
2nd video shows powder on turntable, where the rotation appears to be smooth
