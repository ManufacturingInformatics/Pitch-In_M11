Attended: Fellicity Freeman (f.freeman@sheffield.ac.uk), OH , MF, BS, DBM, DT
1.       Next Steps, they will do a build and one of us can go to film the build. One of us will be invited to film the disassembly and assembly of hooper in next few weeks.
2.       We will receive a hooper (which is not very accurate) to start experimenting. We have to contact manufacturer for specifications and drawing.
3.    Powder is in size of 45-90 . Particles of that size will have health and safety issues, Steel would be safest as compared to Titanium and Nickle.
4.       We can test optical system on outflow of hooper. Rate of flow from small nozzle 7 g/min, big nozzle is 15 g/min.
5.       Thermal camera from John Willmark’s group (EEE). More info from Leigh Stanger. 


Key notes from meeting on 16/04/19:
1. For powder flow sensing:
Weight Sensors in hooper: each powder is different, characteristic of powder, uniformity with which the material is leaving the hopper, capacitance type load cells, 
Will provide hooper for offline testing, (medicoat groove (disking groove, hooper feeder), ??)
2. Melt pool characterisation: thermal camera is already there but looks into one direction (observes melt pool from above), can access that, orthogonal camera (to see from side)
should be able to use: john’s camera, can put second camera. 
Can use shiny Stainless steel, can loan thermal cameras, John willmark’s camera
3. Atomiser (RTC, factory 2050) : Boyang can use load cell  for atomiser, (contact Rob Daffley). Prof Iain Todd to Arrange visit for Boyang.
